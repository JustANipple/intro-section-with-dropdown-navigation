## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- JavaScript

### Continued development

I need to work more on making reusable components. I tried to make some dropdown components to have a standard menu for future challenges, but the code looks a mess

### Useful resources

- [Menu animation](https://codinhood.com/micro/10-dropdown-menu-animations-css-transform) - I used this site to learn how to make a menu animation
